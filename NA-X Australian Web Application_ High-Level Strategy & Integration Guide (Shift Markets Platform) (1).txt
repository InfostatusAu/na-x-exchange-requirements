1. Introduction & Purpose
1.1. Objective
This document outlines the high-level strategy and technical integration approach for developing the NA-X custom web application for the Australian market. This application will serve as the primary user interface for Australian clients to interact with the NA-X cryptocurrency exchange services.
1.2. Core Technology & Regulatory Context
The NA-X Australian exchange will be powered by the Shift Markets white-label platform as its core backend infrastructure.1 All exchange functionalities, including trading, user management, and wallet operations, will be managed through this central system.
NA-X operates in Australia as a Corporate Authorised Representative (CAR) under the Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) held by Trend Capital Group Pty Ltd (Trend). This regulatory structure mandates that all financial services offered via the web application are within Trend's AFSL authorisations and subject to Trend's oversight and compliance framework.10
1.3. Document Scope
This strategy focuses on the web application's architecture, key functional modules, integration points with the Shift Markets API and other third-party services, and critical compliance considerations relevant to the Australian CAR model.
2. Core Architectural Principles
The NA-X Australian web application will be built upon the following architectural principles:
* Shift Markets as Backend Authority: The Shift Markets platform is the definitive source of truth for all exchange-related data (user accounts, balances, orders, market data) and business logic execution.1
* Custom NA-X Branded Front-End: The web application will be a custom-developed, NA-X branded interface, providing a unique and tailored user experience.
* API-First Integration: All interactions between the web application and the Shift Markets backend will occur exclusively via the Shift Markets V4 GraphQL API.1 Direct database access or undocumented methods are prohibited.
* Modular & Scalable Design: The web application's architecture will be modular to facilitate easier maintenance, testing, and future feature enhancements.
* Security by Design: Security best practices will be embedded throughout the development lifecycle, from design to deployment and ongoing operations.
* Compliance-Aware Development: Compliance requirements, particularly those stemming from the CAR model and Trend Capital Group's oversight, will be integrated into the design and functionality of relevant modules.
3. Key Functional Modules & Requirements (Australian Web Application)

* Compliance Checkpoint (Design): During Shift Back Office configuration (WP0.1, S0.1.10), identify and configure roles/permissions or reporting functionalities that can satisfy Trend's supervision needs.
* Compliance Checkpoint (Process): Formalize the reporting and access protocols in the NA-X/Trend operational agreement (WP0.2, S0.2.3). Conduct periodic reviews with Trend to ensure oversight mechanisms are effective.
7. Development & Technology Stack Considerations
* Front-End Framework: Select a modern, robust JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) to ensure a responsive, maintainable, and scalable web application.
* API Client: Utilize a mature GraphQL client library (e.g., Apollo Client, Relay) for efficient interaction with the Shift Markets V4 API.
* State Management: Implement a predictable and scalable client-side state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Vuex).
* Security Practices:
   * Adhere to OWASP Top 10 security principles.
   * Implement secure local storage for any client-side sensitive data (minimize where possible).
   * Ensure all communication is over HTTPS.
   * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other relevant browser security headers.
   * Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Testing Strategy:
   * Unit Tests: For individual components and functions.
   * Integration Tests: For interactions between front-end modules and API services.
   * End-to-End (E2E) Tests: For critical user flows (e.g., registration, deposit, trade, withdrawal).
   * Security Testing: Including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments before launch and periodically thereafter.
* Deployment: Establish a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for automated testing and deployment to staging and production environments.
* Hosting: The web application itself will be hosted separately from the Shift Markets backend (which Shift hosts on AWS [User Query]). Choose a suitable hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Netlify) for the front-end application.
8. High-Level Phased Implementation Approach (Australian Web App)
This aligns with the main project roadmap, focusing on AU web app deliverables and compliance checks.
8.1. Phase 0: Foundation & Due Diligence
